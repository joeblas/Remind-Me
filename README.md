# Remind Me

A web app built to help you throw away to-do lists! Remind Me is built on Node and Express with Handlebars handling the views. Remind me utilizes passport.js for authentication. 

What makes Remind Me work? That's a good question, my friend. The Twilio API. Remind Me uses Twilio's API to send SMS messages when the user wants to be reminded.

Simple as that. Best of all... there are more features to come.
